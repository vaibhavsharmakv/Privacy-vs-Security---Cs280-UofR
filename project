 proffesor remarks - Ahmad, Sharma. Privacy versus security. A good topic but fairly broadly written. Try to focus on the application of this issue to a specific context. Siri, Alexa etc is a good place to start, but make sure to consider Canadian implications of these technologies specifically (i.e. do these devices work differently in Canada than in the U.S.? are the results better/worse? Are the privacy implications different? Is there a PIPEDA document you can find?). Weâ€™re covering the patriot act in class, so I would encourage you to dig a little deeper into how this tech works, and the tradeoffs therein.

Agenda for week feb 11 - feb 21
- try talking to proffesor and other groups about mock mock trial 
- make a outline for research
